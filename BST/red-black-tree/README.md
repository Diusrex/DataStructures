# Red Black Tree Implementation

This is an implementation of a Red Black Tree in C++11. It is not optimized, but rather separates the different cases as much as possible to make it easier to see how each of the cases work. If you want to see a visualization of a Red Black Tree, see [this visualizer from the University of San Fransisco](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RedBlack.html).

I have created posts for an [introduction to Red Black Trees](http://www.diusrex.com/2017/02/red-black-trees-introduction), and how to [implement insertion](http://www.diusrex.com/2017/02/painless-red-black-tree-implementation-insertion). In the next few weeks I will be adding a post for deletion, which I will also link to from here.

The testing code is a mess, since it wasn't implemented using any testing framework, and I would like to change this but don't have the time.

Of course, I looked at a few different sources to ensure I was implementing it correctly:
